      that NSAIDs use is estimated 18 times higher for getting encephalopathy

      Medical Association of Osaka Prefecture) showed that NSAIDs use was 
      related with getting Reye's syndrome. As individual case was described in 
      the study report, we recalculated the data and found that only 8.3 % of 
      the patients with encephalopathy other than Reye's syndrome used NSAIDs, 
      while 36.7 % of those with clinically diagnosed Reye's syndrome used 
      NSAIDs and 53.8 % of those with definitely diagnosed Reye's syndrome used 
      NSAIDs.<br>　It can be expressed that NSAIDs is 13 times more 
      risky than non-user for getting definitely diagnosed Reye's syndrome 
      (statistically p=0.0042) and 6 times more risky for getting clinically 
      diagnosed Reye's syndrome (statistically p=0.017).

      mefenamic acid and diclofenac was more frequently used in definite or

      commented especially mefenamic acid, &quot;it should be 
      noticed.&quot;<br>[4] They also said &quot;It was noted that the proportion 
      of the users of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as mefenamic 
      acid or diclofenac NA among patients with Reye's syndrome seemed increase 
      in 1988 and after than in 1987 and before.&quot; Moreover, they pointed out 
      that the survey carried out in the Kinki districts (Osaka and neighbor 
      prefectures) showed the similar results and they said, &quot;These were the 
      remarkable findings&quot;.<br>[5] In the report for 1994 (made in 1996), more 
      remarkable findings were described: among nine patients with definite 
      Reye's syndrome 8 (89 %) used NSAIDs, while among 44 with encephalopathy

      close association between Reye's syndrome or severe flu-related 
      encephalopathy and NSAIDs. By including two studies done in 1999 and in 
      2000, the number of the studies that showed the close association between 
      them is at least eight. Thus none should say that NSAIDs use is only the 
      promoting factor of the severity of encephalopathy and not the cause 
      inducing Reye's syndrome or severe encephalopathy. We have to think that 
      NSAIDs is working at the point inducing Reye's syndrome or severe 
      encephalopathy. So it is very important not to use NSAIDs as antipyretics 
      to lower the body temperature in the infection including flu or common
