      (NOSCAL in Japan and REZULINE in the US) should be 
      banned.<br>And it was finally withdrawn from the US market and 
      subsequently withdrawn also from the Japanese market in March 2000. It was 
      too late but of course an inevitable measure. However where have gone the 
      interest which they earn by selling almost 200 million US dollars in Japan 
      and 700 million US dollars in the US?. Who our cost for insurance  would cover? How about the compensation for the 
      victims who suffered from the adverse reaction to Noscal 
      (Rezuline)?<br>　Troglitazone have been withdrawn, but we become 
      anxious about the safety of ACTOS that was approved in November 1999 and 
      might be used increasingly instead of Noscal 
      (Rezuline).<br>　So NPOJIP precisely analyzed the data of ACTOS used 
      for the approval. It was found that ACTOS might be as harmful as Noscal 
      (Rezuline). <br></SPAN></FONT></P>

            that problem is not only for heart failure.<br>　</font></span><FONT face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">The 
      final endpoints of the management of diabetes mellitus are to prevent 
      complications in cardiovascular system, kidney and retina (eye) and to 
      prolong comfortable life. But ACTOS will almost definitely increase heart 
      diseases including heart failure, myocardial infarction (heart attack) 
      and/or cardiac arrhythmia. Heart complications are observed frequently not 
      only in the animal study but also in the clinical trials. For example, 
      among patients who were treated with ACTOS for more than half a year, only 
      one myocardial infarction was reported as those classified as severe heart 
      diseases. However among the heart diseases classified as moderate heart 
      diseases, one was revealed actually as myocardial infarction, eight were 
      increased heart-lung ratio (this means almost heart failure), three were 
      abnormal echocardiogram, one had difficult breath on exercise, one had 
      moderate pounding heart, seven had abnormal electrocardiogram including 
      atrial fibrillation (a sort of cardiac arrhythmia), totally 22 patients 
      had any moderate or severe heart complications among 321 patients-year: 
      this means 6.8 patients among 100 patients treated with ACTOS will get 
      moderate or severe heart diseases within one 
      year.<br>　We 
      surveyed clinical trials of ACTOS and of other drugs for diabetes 
      mellitus. We selected placebo groups of clinical trials of ACTOS and 
      experimental group as well as control group of clinical trials for other 
      drugs for diabetes mellitus as control of ACTOS. Only one myocardial 
      infarction, two patients with asthma or breath difficulty, totally tree 
      was the moderate or severe complication with these treatment for 599 
      person-year, i.e. 0.6 per 100 person per year. These shows that ACTOS much 
      more easy to induce heart disease (it is expressed as p=5.45&times;10-8 ). <br>　Abnormality other 
      than heart was 2.8 per 100 per year for both ACTOS and for control (3.0 
      for Noscal) with no difference. However if you combine ACTOS and Noscal 
      (Rezuline), incidence of cancer is significantly higher and that of peptic 
      ulcer is tend to be higher for them than for others.<br>　As these 
      comparisons are not the results obtained by randomized controlled trials 
      (drawing-lots-trials), they are merely one of the information. But in the 
      animal studies, lowest effective dose enlarged heart and reduced bone 
      weight, dose of four times dose of lowest effective dose have induced 
      cardiomyopathy with necrosis of heart muscle and lung bleeding both of 
      that did not recover. Above that dose, mortality increased. So, 
      considering together with the results of the animal toxicity studies, 
      ACTOS should be considered as more dangerous especially for heart.<br>　Japan Institute of 
      Pharmacovigilance (JIP) has requested the Minister of Health and Welfare 
      to withdraw ACTOS immediately from the market on the 6th October 2000. 
      Subsequently, NPOJIP, TIP and Med Watcher Japan (Yakugai Ombudspersons 
      Committee) as well requested that ACTOS should be banned and should be 
      recalled. on 10th October
