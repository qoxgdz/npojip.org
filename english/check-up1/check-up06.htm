      mutual understanding between patiants and doctors and other health 
      professionals continues to be the exception. Until recently medical 
      students have not been taught communication skills, and mostdoctors have 
      either learnt them on their own, or never discovered that they donot 
      communicate well. That remains a major problem in most countries, 
      andit is good to know that it is now getting more attention in 
      Japan.</SPAN></FONT></P>

      face="Times New Roman"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">n order to be able to 
      talk with a doctor or pahrmacist, a patient needs some basic understanding 
      of illness, symptoms and medicines. When one is ill, it istoo late 
      to study medicine---there is so much to learn and to understand. 
      Butfortunately it is not difficult to learn a few important 
      questions that the patient can ask the doctor, and that cannot be called 
      `stupid questions'. </SPAN></FONT></p>

      face="Times New Roman"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">or example, it is 
      often reasonable to ask the doctor about the diagnosis, and how certain it 
      is. When the doctor suggests a drug, the patient needs to knowwhat 
      can be expected from it---whether it is aimed at one or more symptoms, or 
      can be a cure, and how likely it is to be effetive, and how long it will 
      take to work. For example, if it works in fewer than half the people 
      who take it, or can cause unpleasant effects, then the patient may prefer 
      to accept the symptoms and wait for them to disappear on their own. 
      Of course once the patient has obtained the medicine, she or he also 
      has to know when and how to take it, what to look out for, whether to 
      avoid particular activities or foods, and so on. </SPAN></FONT></p>

      need drug treatment, or are uncertain whether they need it, it is 
      difficult to distinguish good pills from bad ones. The reason is that many 
      pharmaceutical companies, and also some authorities, make greatly 
      exaggerated claims that a product is effective and safe. You will 
      find that the bulletin will help you to distinguish them, because it 
      evaluates the scientific evidence according to international standards and 
      takes specialcare to eliminate or minimise biases. </SPAN></FONT></P>

      bulletin will give various examples of informative and helpful 
      conversations between doctors and patients, as well as of unsuccessful 
      encounters and misunderstandings. Both patients and doctors can 
      learn a lot from such stories.</SPAN></FONT></P>
