            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;"><font face="Times New Roman">Å@I 
            wrote on this column three weeks ago that the government of UK and 
            The Netherlands already ban Halcion. Several days later, the manufacturer 
            claimed that it was not true.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;"><font face="Times New Roman">Å@I 
            examined carefully and found that the prohibition against the sale 
            of Halcion was lifted after they banned it for Åe80~Åf90 in The 
            Netherlands and Åe91~Åf93 in UK.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;"><font face="Times New Roman">Å@However, 
            it has never been remarketed in UK because of strict conditions 
            for the manufacturer and it has been rarely sold in the Netherlands 
            because it is not reimbursed by the insurance.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;"><font face="Times New Roman">Å@Halcion 
            was started to sell by 1mg. But the strength was reduced little 
            by little because the psychiatric side effects had gradually emerged 
            also in many other countries. The manufacture says that Halcion 
            is now marketed in 80 countries, but in most cases it is sold by 
            the strength of 0.125 or 0.25mg with strict warnings. Some countries 
            restrict its selling to only 0.125 mg tablet.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;"><font face="Times New Roman">Å@The 
            role of the government is important. Now here is an extract from 
            an instruction of Halcion for patients in US.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;"><font face="Times New Roman">Å@Åg 
            Sleeping pills that are eliminated rapidly, eg, Halcion, tend to 
            cause more withdrawal symptoms (the symptoms which are seen in case 
            by stopping or by reducing pills). Halcion is more likely than other 
            sleeping pills to cause temporary memory loss during &nbsp;several 
            hours after taking it. Increased wakefulness at mid-night appearance 
            of increased signs of daytime anxiety. The withdrawal symptom includes 
            worsening of insomnia, vomiting, sweating, tremor and rarely, convulsions.Åh</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;"><font face="Times New Roman">Å@On 
            the other hand, Japan has the largest market share of Halcion in 
            the world. It sales 7.5 billion yen per year in Japan that is 60% 
            of the whole world market. The package insert of Halcion for doctors 
            in Japan has warning of three lines in which delirium may appear. 
            Though an instruction of Halcion for patients has six items, including 
            Ågplease take this drug immediately before you sleep, and after 
            you completed preparing to sleepÅh. They donÅft carry enough information 
            about side effect. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:14pt;"><font face="Times New Roman">Å@If 
            you use a small quantity of rapidly-acting drug for a short period, 
            you could get out of using it even if you might put up with difficulty 
            in sleeping for a few days. You donÅft need to be nervous because 
            lying with oneÅfs eyes closed is half as effective as full sleep. 
            It recommended that if you use a large quantity of drug or if you 
            use it for a long term youÅfd better change into a long-acting one 
            and then reduce it gradually. Please consult a doctor who see and 
            hear you conscientiously.</font></span></p>
