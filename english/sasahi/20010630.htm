            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">Å@The 
            newspapers recently reported that the cut-off value of high cholesterol 
            level would be changed from Åg220Åh toÅg240Åh.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">Å@I 
            suppose that some of those who are always diagnosed as Åghigh cholesterolÅh 
            at medical check-up or who are taking cholesterol- lowering medicines 
            might be surprised.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">Å@Everyone 
            hopes for being healthy. And everyone knows that nutrient is important 
            for health. However there are a lot of misunderstandings or plausible 
            explanations about detailed contents of nutrients. In some case, 
            fragmentary knowledge is excessively emphasized. </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">Å@So 
            we sometimes need to check them carefully. IÅfd like you all to 
            think basically over why ÅgnutrientÅh is important. It must be the 
            best way to use drug effectively and safely that you are not become 
            ill and you need no drug. The correct knowledge about nutrients 
            is Åga good medicineÅh against not only infectious diseases or Diabetes 
            Mellitus but also allergy and cancer.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">Å@LetÅfs 
            run through again, human body has various protection system such 
            as inflammatory response and immunity to protect from foreign bodies 
            not only outside but also inside of oneÅfs body. To keep the best 
            condition, blood vessels, nerves, hormonal system, and enzymes promptly 
            react in a well-balanced manner. Fundamental elements in every organ 
            that support these important functions are cells. To make these 
            cells active, the firm structure and efficient energy are essential. 
            It is like automobiles need durable bodies and clean and efficient 
            energy-rich fuel to keep good driving.. </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">Å@The 
            cleanest and the most efficient energy for human is glucose. It 
            is made of carbohydrates. </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">Å@The 
            materials of healthy human body structure are protein and fat (cholesterol 
            or oil). Strong cell membrane and tissue, enzymes essential for 
            metabolism and elements of blood are made of these two elements.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">Å@Carbohydrates, 
            protein and fat are three major nutrients. Some may imagine vitamins 
            or minerals as essential nutrients. For example the typical Japanese 
            over-the-counter Åhhealthy drinkable pillÅh contains up to 2mg of 
            amino acid (a material of protein). ItÅfs only a quarter of that 
            of an egg. Though it also contains from several to ten times vitamins 
            as much as one needs for one day, too much vitamins are merely excreted 
            into the urine. </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">Å@If 
            you steadily take three major nutrients through meals, you can take 
            enough vitamins or minerals in it.Three major nutrients are paramount 
            for your health.</span></font></p>
