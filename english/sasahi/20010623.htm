            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">Å@There 
            were various reactions to the last weekÅfs column on tranquilizers. 
            One person claimed Ågone of my family panicked because the column 
            pointed out that tranquilizers have harm. Patients may not be saved 
            unless the column described how to handle with the harm of the tranquilizersÅh.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">Å@I 
            canÅft write every time but please note that not all people suffer 
            from adverse effects of drugs although every drug may cause adverse 
            effects. Some may use a drug effectively and safely. But I had to 
            point out that there were some tranquilizers that are easily abused 
            and that in fact, they were substantially abused. </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">Å@The 
            typical case that I got from readers was as follows: I asked my 
            doctor of my side effects but he says ÅgNo problem, for a mild pill.Åh 
            How can I do?</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">Å@The 
            common problem for them is that they are never informed that drugs 
            have both good effects and hazard. They tend to be panic when they 
            are suddenly informed with the negative side of the drug.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">Å@Properly 
            speaking, patients should inquire doctors or pharmacists about their 
            drugs and whether they are suffering from drugÅfs side effects or 
            not. But rarely they can. If a patient asks the doctor, they seldom 
            get an straight answer. Those may be the background of the many 
            questions to us. On the other hand, doctors donÅft have enough time 
            to explain patients. There are many problems to be solved. But I 
            cannot help saying that patients should ask your doctors or pharmacists 
            about the drugs frankly.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">Å@If 
            your symptom is stable and your amount of pills is small and donÅft 
            increase, donÅft worry please. </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">Å@Then 
            try to face the original cause that make you need tranquilizers 
            or sleeping pills. This is very important especially for those whose 
            dosage is increasing. One tends to become difficult to sleep or 
            anxious by some events such as a new work, new school, failure in 
            business or failure in an examination. Anti-anxiety drugs or sleeping 
            pill are easily prescribed by doctors and easily used by such persons.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">Å@But 
            make sure that drugs are unnecessary for the relief of anxiety or 
            tension associated with the stress of every </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">day 
            life that is easily understandable for everyone. This is commonly 
            found in the foreign medical texts or manuals.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">Å@And 
            next, youÅfd better avoid such a drug that is rapid-acting and easy-to-wake-up 
            in the morning because it is easier to cause dependence. And if 
            you use an anti-anxiety drug, please use it only for a short period. 
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">Å@If 
            you are using sleeping pills or anti-anxiety drugs for the relief 
            of anxiety or tension associated with the stress of every day life 
            at the beginning, try to solve the original problem and consult 
            a doctors frankly to get out of using the drugs as soon as possible.
