            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">　Very 
            sad murders have happened in Osaka in which more than ten of elementary-school 
            children were killed and wounded. Today, I would like to write on 
            the tranquilizers that were one of the issues in this case.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">　As 
            it seems denied that tranquilizer was used immediately before the 
            murder, I cannot say whether the drug affected the case or not. 
            But I could say that it is true that tranquilizers are easily abused, 
            although there are many people who truly need tranquilizers. Almost 
            one third of patients are using this group of drugs.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">　For 
            example, sleeping pills are one of these groups. There are many 
            people who became paradoxically anxious and unstable by tranquillizers.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">　One 
            group of tranquilizers is “neuroleptics” for psychotic diseases 
            such as schizophrenia and the other is anti-anxiety drug for neurosis 
            with extreme anxiety. </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">　The 
            former was formerly called as major tranquillizer that is very strong 
            not only in efficacy but also in adverse effects. On the other hand 
            the latter was formerly called as minor tranquilizer. But it is 
            not merely gentle or tender. Some of them are very strong for sleeping 
            pills with very rapid action. Their harm is sometimes big.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">　For 
            example, Triazolam (Brand name is Halcion etc.) is a drug of social 
            issue about ten years ago. It acts well with rapidly falling asleep 
            and easily getting awake initially. So it is easily abused. It is 
            underground-marketed with high price.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">　But 
            the duration of action is only about 3 hours. One tends to get awake 
            at midnight and to get difficult to re-sleep. One tends to be dependent 
            on the drug if one habitually uses it. Ability for judge and for 
            memory in daytime may decrease; one may tend to be irritable, anxious 
            or agitated. Elderly person may have dementia-like symptom with 
            this drug. Dependent person may be convulsed or hallucinated with 
            withdrawal symptom when one stopped taking it suddenly. It is very 
            similar to alcohol in many respects.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">　One 
            may be unable to remember what he or she did if one take the drug 
            and get up at night even though he or she apparently behave normal 
            as if deep drunken may loose his memory. This phenomenon is called 
            antegrade amnesia.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">　A 
            murder case by a dependent person happened in the United States. 
            The drug was banned in UK and in the Netherlands but it is a very 
            commonly prescribed drug in Japan. </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14pt;">It 
            should be recognized that the drug hazards by anti-anxiety drugs 
            might threaten the society.</span></font></p>
