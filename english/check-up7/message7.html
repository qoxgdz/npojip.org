<h3>Access to Medicines should not be Luxury for the Rich but a Right for All
<br /><br />
Ellen't Hoen [1]<br />
Coordinator, Globalisation Project of Medecins sans Frontieres Access to Essential Medicines Campaign</h3>
<br />
Infectious diseases kill 17 million people each year, and more than ninety percent of these deaths occur 
in the developing world [2]. The leading causes of illness and death in Africa, Asia and South America, 
regions that account for four-fifths of the world's population are HIV/AIDS, respiratory infections, malaria and tuberculosis.<br />
<br />
In particular the magnitude of the AIDS crisis has drawn attention to the fact that millions of people 
in the developing world do not have access to the medicines that are needed to treat the diseases or alleviate suffering. 
Each day 8,000 people die of AIDS in the developing world. The reasons for the lack of access to essential medicines 
are manifold, but in many cases the high prices of drugs throw up a barrier to needed treatments. 
Prohibitive drug prices are often a result of strong intellectual property protection. 
Countries that attemp to bring the price of medicines down have come under pressure from industrialized countries and 
the pharmaceutical industry. The most notorious example is the court case brought in 2001 by 39 pharmaceutical companies 
against the South African government to stop the implementation of the Medicines and Related Substances Control Amendment 
Act, No. 90 of 1997 (Amendment Act). *<br />
<br />
Another reason for the unavailability of needed medicins is the fact that research and development (R&D) towards the 
health needs of people in developing countries has almost come to a standstill. 
Despite the enormous burden of disease, drug discovery and development targeted at infectious and parasitic diseases 
in poor countries has virtually ground to standstill [3]. Of the 1,223 new drugs approved between 1975 and 1997, 
13 (less than 1%) were specifically to treat tropical diseases [4]. Developing countries where three-quaters of the 
world population lives account for less than 10% of the global pharmaceutical market. Money speaks louder than 
health needs when it comes to setting R&D priorities of the pharmaceutical industry.<br />
<br />
<b>Is the tide turning?</b><br />
<br />
The debate on the need to take measures to increase access to the medicines for people in developing countries is 
taking on a global dimension. There are encouraging signals that the tide is turning.<br />
<br />
The global debate on access to medicines has encouraged generic and brand name drug companies to offer key medicines 
at lower prices. Today, the cheapest generic antiretroviral combination therapy offered to developing countries costs 
a little over 200 USD. Three years ago the price of triple therapy was 15,000 USD.<br />
<br />
This years updated 12th model list on essential medicines (EDL) of the World Health Organisation is another 
important step forward. The Essential Medicines Committee added 10 antiretrovirals to the core essential medicines 
list and highlighted the importance of fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) of certain antiretrovirals.<br />
<br />
Previously essential medicines were often excluded from the WHO essential medicines list on the grounds that 
they were too expensive. This new policy is recognition of the fact that high prices should not be taken for 
granted and that countries are encouraged to take measures to bring th cost down. WHO is also helping countries to 
access more affordable medicines through the pre-qualification fo manufactures and through the publication of 
treatment guidelines to encourage the rational use of the medicines.<br />
<br />
The 4th WTO Ministerial Conference in November 2001 in Doha adopted the "Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health", 
which affirmed the sovereign right of governments to take measures to protect public helath. The declaration is an 
important political and legal document that gives primacy to public health over private intellectual property and 
clarifies WTO Members' rights to override patents if they form a barrier to access to medicines. This is an important 
step to ensure that intellectual property protection serves the broader public interest beyond that of the commercial 
sector.<br />
<br />
<b>Challenge Remains</b><br />
<br />
An area where attention is urgently needed is the lack of R&D into new drugs for specific health needs of the poor. 
Recent studies claim that the R&D cost of a commercial drug company per new pharmaceutical product is 802 million USD [5]. 
The Global Alliance for Turberculosis Drug Development, a not-for-profit entity for R&D for TB drugs, estimated that 
the total R&D cost for a new TB drug, including the cost of failure is between 115 million USD and 140 million USD [6]. 
The high R&D cost claimed by the commercial pharmaceutical sector poses some key questions: Is the present system for 
funding R&D the most efficient, and is it sufficient to rely on the intellectual property systems to fuel innovation? 
Clearly in the area of neglected diseases it is not. In an increasingly globalized economy additional international 
mechanisms need to be developed to address health needs in developing countries that are neglected by the market. 
This will be the key challenge for the coming years. Essential drugs should not be a luxury reserved for the wealthy 
but should be reinforced as a critical component of the human right to health.<br />

South Africa, where 4.7 million people out of the total population of 40 million are suffering from HIV/AIDS, 
revised its Pharmaceutical Affairs Law to enable easier access to essential drugs. 
However, 39 pharmaceutical companies sued the South Afircan government, in order to protect their intelectual property, 
claiming that the revision was against the constitution. 
The case was withdrawn in the end. 
However, this was not considered solely as South African's problem, 
but attracted world' attention as "North-South inequality of medicine".
